# Random Password Generator

Random password generator is a program that creates customized passwords for users. 
It helps users to create stronger passwords that provide greater security.

In this project, the user has to select the password length and then click on the Generate Password button. It will show the generated password. If the user clicks on the Copy To Clipboard button, then it will copy the password automatically.

I have used an Azure service called "Static Web App Service" for hosting my project and to demonstrate the live working of the project.
